Specification: To write a C# console application that prints "Hello, World!" to the console, follow these steps:

1. Open a text editor and create a new file named "HelloWorld.cs", or another name of your choosing but it must have the .cs file extension.

2. Type the following code into your text editor:

```csharp
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

3. Save the file and close your text editor.

4. Open your system's command prompt.

5. Navigate to the directory where you saved "HelloWorld.cs".

6. To compile your new program, type `csc HelloWorld.cs` at the command prompt and press enter. If the code has no errors, this will create an executable file in the same directory.

7. To run your program, type `HelloWorld` and press enter.

8. The message "Hello, World!" will be displayed in the command prompt window.
